## Quick visual / small

### A. Look overlay — creator name next to avatar
On an open look, the lower-left has the creator avatar (+ follow badge) but
no name. Show the creator's name next to the avatar.
- File: `app/components/LookOverlay.tsx` (corner avatar / `CreatorAvatarFollow` area).

### B. Mobile feed — dark gradient between top UI and feed
On mobile web the header is `background: transparent` (`app/styles/header.css`
~line 725, inside the `@media (max-width:768px)` block), so the wordmark /
icons / creator-stories row float over bright feed cards with no scrim.
Add a dark top gradient on mobile **without** moving the chrome (header is
`height:48px; align-items:center`) and **without** affecting the Flutter
shell (the shell hides the webapp `header` via `html[data-shell] header`).
Prefer a `header::before` fixed scrim (top 0, ~120px, gradient → transparent,
`pointer-events:none`) — but check for existing header frost pseudo-elements
first (`header.css` ~line 89).

### C. Generate / Queueing ("Vision") — one viewport
Condense the queueing screen so it doesn't scroll (single viewport).
- File: `app/routes/generate.tsx` (queueing/progress step).

## Medium

### D. Look overlay — make it like the product screen
1. Comments should be its **own button** (like the product page's Comments
   button), NOT the floating green chat bubble.
2. **Remove the "About" tab** (tabs are currently Products | About).
3. Move the AI creator summary (currently in the About tab) into a
   **"View more info"** section, mirroring the product page.
- Files: `app/components/LookOverlay.tsx` (tabs ~line 879, About tab ~951,
  AI summary `aboutSummary`), `app/styles/look-overlay.css`.

### E. Product page — Comments as a bottom drawer (TikTok-style)
Comments currently navigate to `/comments/:type/:slug` (full page,
`CommentsPage`). Instead open an **in-place bottom drawer** that overlays the
product page and scrolls internally (TikTok comment-sheet feel). Reuse
`CommentsPage`'s comment logic inside a bottom sheet.
- Files: `app/components/ProductPage.tsx` (`onOpenComments` ~line 1268),
  `app/components/CommentsPage.tsx`, `app/routes/_index.tsx` (router wiring).

### F. Search overlay — keyboard-dismiss layout breaks
When the soft keyboard dismisses while the search overlay is open, the pills
and search bar overlap (broken transitional layout). FRAGILE: this is the
heavily-tuned `kbInset` / bottom-bar keyboard-pinning code.
- File: `app/components/BottomBar.tsx` (`kbInset`, the `searchOpen` inline
  `style`), `app/styles/bottom-bar.css`.

### G. Generate / Style step
- Make the style presets (Street, Editorial, …) **horizontally scrollable**.
- Allow the user to **enter their own description**; if they do, send that
  custom description to **Seedance** for generation.
- File: `app/routes/generate.tsx` (Style step), plus the Seedance prompt
  path (custom style already persists via `profiles.custom_style_prompt` +
  the Seedance prompt threading — extend for a per-generation override).

### H. Generate / Review step
- Toggling **Fast ↔ Pro** should NOT shift the layout (keep it stable).
- Add a **Weight** row (alongside Height / Age).
- Condense to **one viewport** (no scroll).
- File: `app/routes/generate.tsx` (Review step).

### I. Generate / Queueing — "analyzing" + jokes + intense particles
On the queueing screen, show an "analyzing" state with rotating **funny
jokes** (words ticker), and throw the **WebGL particle effect** in there
turned way up (intense / "going crazy").
- Files: `app/routes/generate.tsx`, `app/components/ParticleBackground.tsx`
  (or `SiteParticleHost`).

### J. In-progress generation pill → follow-toast format
The "Your commercial look is in process" pill at the top should use the same
notification **format** as the follow toast (`FollowToastHost` /
`.follow-toast`). Unify the styles.
- Files: `app/components/FollowToastHost.tsx`, the pending-look pill
  (`header.css` ~line 150 `.pending-look-pill`), wherever the pill renders.

### K. Activity — in-progress generation row
On `/activity`, if a look is generating, show a row at the top with a
**horizontal progress bar** (how far along) and the same **joke/words
ticker** as the queueing screen.
- File: `app/routes/activity.tsx`, `app/services/activity.ts`.

## Large

### L. My Catalog — Products tab + per-creator product reorder
Replace tabs with **Live · Inactive | Products** (the "All" tab was already
removed; a visual divider separates the status tabs from Products). The
**Products** tab lists EVERY product across all the creator's looks
(deduped), and the creator can **drag-reorder** them (vertical-only drag).
- Needs a new table, e.g. `creator_product_order (user_id, product_id,
  sort_order, pk(user_id,product_id))` + owner RLS, and a service to
  aggregate look products + persist order. Mirror the look drag-reorder
  already in `MyLooks.tsx` (grip handle + pointer events).
- Files: `app/components/MyLooks.tsx`, `app/services/manage-looks.ts`,
  new migration.

### M. Creator catalog appearance settings (customization)
In My Catalog, add a **settings gear** (appearance). Options:
1. **Particles on/off** — when on, render the particle field on the
   creator's catalog/consumer surfaces.
2. **Color wheel** — selecting a color tints the catalog **background with
   that hue**.
Per-creator, persisted. NOTE: a `creator_catalog_theme` migration already
exists (`20260601191547_creator_catalog_theme`) — check what columns it
has before adding more.
- Files: `app/components/MyLooks.tsx` (gear), consumer surfaces that read
  the theme, `app/services/*`.

### N. Catalog Analytics screen — REBUILD (intentional) + animated graphs
The creator Catalog Analytics screen (`CreatorAnalyticsModal` in
`app/components/MyLooks.tsx` ~lines 763–997; CSS `.my-cat-analytics-*` in
`app/styles/my-looks.css`) is visually broken: the header (title + close ×)
and the date-range pill row (All time / Today / Yesterday / This week / Last)
**overlap at the top** — they render on the same vertical band instead of
stacking, and the main app header/wordmark appears to bleed through. The
earlier title-truncation patch did NOT fix it; the layout needs a real
rebuild, not another patch.

Rebuild requirements:
- Clean, intentional layout: header row (title + ×) clearly above the
  range-pill row, which is clearly above the stat grid. No overlap, proper
  top safe-area clearance. Investigate the conflicting/duplicate
  `.my-cat-analytics-card--page` rules (there are two: ~3565 and ~3601).
- Add **graphs** with **very thin lines**.
- The graph bars/lines **animate from left to right** with a **pulsing
  light on the leading front** (the draw head glows/pulses).
- Easing **ease-in-out**, **very slow and subtle**.
- Keep it tasteful and on-brand (dark theme, hairline strokes).

## Feed ordering algorithm (DETAILED SPEC — investigate + implement)

Per-user, qualify **each impression** on a product AND a look as seen/unseen.

1. **All unseen** → show in the **admin-prepared order** (`feed_rank`).
2. **All seen** → **randomize**.
3. **Half seen / half unseen** → unseen first (admin order); once the user
   scrolls past the unseen into the seen items, the **seen portion is
   randomized**.
4. The "random" must keep **fluidity to product type** — cluster by type
   (all shoes together, then all shirts, etc.). Grouped random, NOT pure
   random.

Current state: `reorderBySeen()` in `app/services/looks.ts:457` already does
unseen-first / shuffle-seen, but:
- It does NOT cluster the shuffled portion by product type (item 4 — TODO).
- Reported symptom: "same order every visit." Likely the **seen-tracking
  isn't populating** (`seenLookIds` empty) so it stays in deterministic
  `feed_rank` order. Investigate the viewed-look / impression recording so
  items actually get marked seen. Also confirm products (not just looks)
  are seen-qualified and ordered.
